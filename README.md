# ProductBuzz-Analysis
Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a system that can analyse tweets related to an 
upcoming product in order to gain insights about consumer sentiment and public 
perception. This information can be used by the company to make informed 
decisions about the marketing and promotion of the product.

Methodology:
The system will be built on top of the Twitter API, which will allow us to access a 
stream of tweets in real-time. We will use natural language processing techniques to 
filter and process these tweets, extracting relevant information such as the sentiment 
of the tweet (positive, negative, or neutral) and any mentions of the product.
Once the tweets have been processed, We will use data visualization techniques to 
create charts and graphs that help to illustrate trends and patterns in the data. For 
example, we might create a line chart to show how the sentiment of tweets has 
changed over time.
In addition to visualizing the data, we will also use machine learning techniques to 
build predictive models that can be used to forecast consumer sentiment in the 
future. For example, we might train a model to predict whether a tweet about the 
product is likely to be positive or negative based on the words used in the tweet.
One potential application of this system is to use it to monitor the success of a 
product launch. By tracking the sentiment of tweets related to the product, the 
company can get a sense of how well the launch is being received by consumers. 
This information can be used to make adjustments to the marketing and promotion 
of the product in order to maximize its success.

Outcome:
Overall, this project has the potential to provide valuable insights for companies 
looking to launch a new product. By analysing tweets related to the product, we can 
gain a better understanding of consumer sentiment and public perception, which can 
be used to inform marketing and promotional strategies.
